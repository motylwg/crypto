## Crypto

This project provides the CryptoString class that was developed for use in Coursera's Cryptotography I course.

In order to abide with Coursera's honor code, no actual problems from the course are included or addressed here.
This is merely a utility class to aid in solving the problems in Scala.  It proves a small subset of the functionalities to be found, e.g.in PyCrypto.
