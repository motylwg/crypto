## Crypto

This project provides a CryptoString class that was developed for use in Coursera's Cryptotography I course.

In order to abide with Coursera's honor code, no actual problems from the course are adressed here.  This is merely a utility class providing a small subset of functionalities found in PyCrypto to aid solving the problems so that the problems could be solved in Scala.
